    question { 'In some countries, there is a growing trend of people living alone. Discuss the reasons and effects of this trend.' }
    answer {
      'The trend of people living alone is becoming more prevalent in many countries, and it can be attributed to a variety of factors. 
      In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons for this trend and its potential effects. One of the main reasons for the trend 
      of people living alone is changing societal norms and values. As societies become more individualistic, people are prioritizing 
      personal independence and freedom over traditional family and community structures. Additionally, the rise of women in the workforce 
      has led to more financial independence, and as a result, many women are choosing to live alone. Another reason for the trend of people 
      living alone is technological advancements. With the rise of social media and other digital platforms, people are able to connect with 
      others virtually, making it easier to maintain relationships without physical proximity. As a result, people may feel less of a need for 
      physical companionship. There are several potential effects of this trend. On one hand, living alone can have positive effects on mental 
      health, as it can provide a sense of autonomy and reduce the stress that can come with living with others. Additionally, living alone can 
      lead to greater opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. On the other hand, living alone can also lead to feelings of 
      isolation and loneliness, which can have negative effects on mental health. Additionally, living alone can lead to a lack of social 
      support, which can be particularly challenging for older adults who may need assistance as they age. In conclusion, the trend of people 
      living alone can be attributed to changing societal values, as well as technological advancements. While there are potential positive 
      effects of living alone, there are also potential negative effects, and it is important to consider the needs of individuals and 
      communities as this trend continues to grow. It is essential for individuals to maintain social connections and support systems,
      whether that be through virtual means or physical proximity.'
